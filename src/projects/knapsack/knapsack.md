# Knapsack cryptosystem

Implement Hellman-Merkle knapsack cryptosystem and pass the provided tests to verify your implementation.

Here are some assumptions and implementation details:

1. The exact values of the superincreasing knapsack you generate are not important as long as the superincreasing property holds and the values are large enough. See the Merkle-Hellman paper for details.
2. Calculate `n` as the smallest number greater than the sum of values in the superincreasing knapsack.
3. Calculate `m` as the largest number in the range `[1, n)` that is co-prime of `n`.
4. The output of the function `encrypt` is a list of integers or a single integer value.
5. Pay additional attention to the cases where plaintext is shorter than 1 full character.
