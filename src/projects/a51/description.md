# A5/1 Cipher

Implement **A5/1** cipher.

## Implementation

Implement functions `populate_registers`, `majority`, `step_x`, `step_y`, `step_z`, `generate_bit`, `generate_keystream`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, and `encrypt_file` in the *a51_cipher.py* and pass the provided tests.

Note that some functions return numbers as `int` and some - as `str`. See the type annotations for specifics.

## Assumptions

Treat each file as a continuous sequence of bytes, making no distinction between characters and newline symbols.
